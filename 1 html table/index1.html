                iconic and majestic animals in the animal
                 kingdom. Known as the "King of the Jungle,"
                  lions are not typically found in jungles
                   but thrive in savannas, grasslands,
                    and open woodlands. 
                    They are native to Africa and a small
                     population exists in India.</td>
            <td class="ok1">The one-horned rhinoceros, also known as the 
                Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), is a 
                remarkable species found mainly in the grasslands 
                and forests of the Indian subcontinent. It is 
                celebrated for its distinctive single horn and
                 armor-like skin, giving it a prehistoric appearance.</td>

                The panda, or giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), 
                is a beloved bear species known for its distinctive
                 black-and-white fur and peaceful nature. Native to
                  China, pandas are a global symbol of conservation
                   and are adored for their playful, gentle demeanor.
